# 🛒 E-Commerce Website

**Live Demo:** [e-commerce-website--omega.vercel.app](https://e-commerce-website--omega.vercel.app/)

## 📄 Project Description

This is a full-stack e-commerce web application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** on the frontend, and powered by **Node.js** and **Express.js** on the backend. I built it as part of my Web Design Module in 1st Year of University. It simulates a realistic online shopping experience, including product listings, a functional shopping cart, contact form handling, and secure checkout with Stripe integration.

The website was designed to be responsive and user-friendly, focusing on intuitive design, seamless navigation, and integration with real-world APIs.

## ▶️ Running the Stripe Server

The checkout feature uses Stripe to securely handle payment processing. To enable this locally:

### Commands:

```bash
cd ./Stripe_Checkout
node index
````

Make sure your Stripe secret key is added to a .env file or directly into the index.js file for local testing.

## 💡 Learning Highlights

* Gained practical experience in full-stack web development.
* Learned how to use external APIs (Stripe, Formspree) and handle async requests.
* Applied DOM manipulation and event handling for cart and search features.
* Deployed a live production-ready site using Vercel.
