## ▶️ Running the Stripe Server

The checkout feature uses Stripe to securely handle payment processing. To enable this locally:

### Commands:

```bash
cd ./Stripe_Checkout
node index
````

Make sure your Stripe secret key is added to a .env file or directly into the index.js file for local testing.
